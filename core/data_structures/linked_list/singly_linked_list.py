"""
Implement a Singly Linked List, with all the trimmings.

Interesting facts:
- it is a data structure that allows access to a collection of data using pointers/references
- is very similar to an array but arrays are stored in a continguous block of memory
- nodes of a linked list can be stored anywhere (because of node references)
- insertion in a linked list (in the middle) is inexpensive (compared to an array) because all you need to do change the node references
- whereas inserting into an array requires shifting all subsequent elements and/or creating a new array
